## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Clone the Repo.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the blog starter.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using the blog starter
    git clone https://github.com/dayoaj/powersoft-fruitshop.git
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd powersoft-fruitshop/
    npm install
    npm run start
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:1234`!

    Open the `powersoft-fruitshop` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `index.html`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time thanks to **Parcel**'s hot reload feature!

1.  **Build your project!**

    When done you can build your project for depolyment by running the following command.

    ```shell
    npm run build
    ```

    _Note: Your dev projects build to the **./dist** directory while your final build will go into the **./docs** directory for easy hosting on github pages_
